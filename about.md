# Paste Select Fix
Makes it so when you undo a paste the objects you had selected before the paste get reselected.

For example, if you copy & paste a group of objects and undo the copy & paste, the original objects would be reselected. This is different from vanilla geometry dash where the pasted objects would just be deleted and you would be left with nothing selected.
