# Paste Select Fix
[Geode](https://geode-sdk.org/) mod that makes it so when you undo a paste the objects you had selected before the paste get reselected.

Look at [Geode Docs](https://docs.geode-sdk.org/) for how to build.

if anyone wants to add the IOS binding for createUndoSelectObject that would be nice
